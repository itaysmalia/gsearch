gsearch made by itay S.M

Hello!!
I had an idea to make an app that will help you go another step in your favourite CLI.
gsearch will help you search,filter,list and open your searches.

usage: gsearch.py [-h] [-l] [-q QUERY] [-r RESULTS]
                  [-s SITE] [-S BIGSITE]

BIG Sites: 1 - stackoverflow.com, 2 - github.com, 3 - stackify.com, 4 -
medium.com, 5 - quora.com

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l, --list            list search results in your CLI and open them by index
  -q QUERY [QUERY ...], --query QUERY [QUERY ...]
                        search query
  -r RESULTS [RESULTS ...], --results RESULTS [RESULTS ...]
                        Open results by order (1 for first search result)
  -s SITE, --site SITE  Search ONLY from this soecific site/s
  -S BIGSITE, --bigsite BIGSITE
                        Search ONLY from the specifics bigsite/s.
